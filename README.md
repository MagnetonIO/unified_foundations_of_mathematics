# Unified Foundations of Mathematics

This project establishes a unified foundation for mathematics using universal algebra, homotopy type theory, and topos theory. It includes formal proofs and practical implementations in Haskell and a new abstract programming language.

## Contents

- **Paper**: `unified_foundations.tex` - Formal paper in LaTeX.
- **Haskell Code**: `AlgebraicStructures.hs` - Example Haskell code.
- **Abstract Language Code**: `UniversalAlgebraExamples.txt` - Code examples in the new language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- LaTeX Distribution
- GHC (Haskell Compiler)

### Instructions

1. Compile the LaTeX Paper:
   ```bash
   pdflatex unified_foundations.tex
