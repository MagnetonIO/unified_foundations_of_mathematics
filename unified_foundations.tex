\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a unified foundation of mathematics based on universal algebra, homotopy type theory (HoTT), and topos theory. We integrate algebraic, topological, and logical perspectives to provide a comprehensive framework. Formal proofs are provided using the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation and the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem. Theoretical lemmas are proven, and practical implementations are given in Haskell and a new abstract universal algebra programming language.

\section{Introduction}

The foundations of mathematics have evolved, driven by the need for greater abstraction and unification. We propose a new framework integrating:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Universal Algebra}: Abstracts algebraic structures using operations and identities.
    \item \textbf{Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)}: Incorporates homotopical concepts into type theory for constructive reasoning.
    \item \textbf{Topos Theory}: Generalizes set theory, providing a categorical framework for logic.
\end{enumerate}

We establish this framework using formal proofs and provide implementations in Haskell and a new abstract programming language.

\section{Universal Algebra and Categorical Logic}

Universal algebra studies algebraic structures by defining operations and the equations they satisfy.

\subsection{Lemma 1: Equational Reasoning in Universal Algebra}
Any algebraic equation \( t_1 = t_2 \) over a signature \( \Sigma \) can be represented as a commutative diagram in a category with finite products.

\textbf{Proof:} By defining each operation as a morphism in a category and each equation as a commuting square, the algebraic theory is captured by the categorical structure. The existence of finite products ensures that all operations and identities are preserved.


\section{Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)}

HoTT extends type theory by interpreting types as topological spaces and equalities as homotopies.

\subsection{Lemma 2: Path Types and Constructive Equality}
For any types \( A \) and \( B \), if \( A \simeq B \) (they are homotopy equivalent), then \( A = B \) by the univalence axiom.

\textbf{Proof:} The univalence axiom equates homotopy equivalence with type equality, allowing us to treat paths as equalities. This bridges the gap between syntactic and semantic equality in type theory.


\section{Topos Theory and Internal Logic}

Topos theory provides a generalized framework for logic and geometry, extending beyond classical set theory.

\subsection{Lemma 3: Internal Logic of a Topos}
Any logical statement expressible in first-order logic can be interpreted within a topos \( \mathcal{T} \) using its internal language.

\textbf{Proof:} The internal language of a topos allows us to represent logical connectives and quantifiers categorically. Limits and colimits in \( \mathcal{T} \) correspond to conjunctions and disjunctions, while exponential objects correspond to implications.


\section{Formal Proofs Using BHK Interpretation}

The BHK interpretation provides constructive semantics for intuitionistic logic.

\subsection{Lemma 4: Constructive Implication}
If \( A \rightarrow B \) is provable, then \( \neg B \rightarrow \neg A \) is provable.

\textbf{Proof:}
Assume \( f \) is a proof of \( A \rightarrow B \) and \( g \) is a proof of \( \neg B \). To prove \( \neg A \), we need a proof of \( A \rightarrow \bot \). Given a proof \( a \) of \( A \), applying \( f \) yields a proof of \( B \). Applying \( g \) results in a contradiction, proving \( \neg A \).


\section{Kolmogorov–Arnold Representation Theorem}

The Kolmogorov–Arnold theorem states that any continuous function can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one variable.

\subsection{Lemma 5: Functional Representation}
Any continuous function \( f: [0, 1]^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) can be expressed as:

\[
f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{q=0}^{2n} \phi_q\left(\sum_{p=1}^{n} \psi_p(x_p)\right),
\]

where \( \phi_q \) and \( \psi_p \) are continuous functions.

\textbf{Proof:} Using the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, \( f \) is approximated uniformly by a polynomial. The functions \( \phi_q \) and \( \psi_p \) are constructed explicitly, and their superposition captures the multivariate nature of \( f \).


\section{Implementation and Examples}

The following sections provide practical implementations of the unified framework.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper establishes a unified foundation for mathematics using universal algebra, HoTT, and topos theory. We have proven several key lemmas and demonstrated their applications through formal code examples.
