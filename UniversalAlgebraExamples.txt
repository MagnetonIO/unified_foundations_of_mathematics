-- Define the abstract algebraic structure for a group with three main components:
structure Group(G) {
    -- Binary operation 'multiply' takes two elements from G and returns another element from G.
    operation multiply: G × G → G
    -- Unary operation 'inverse' returns the inverse of an element from G.
    operation inverse: G → G
    -- The 'identity' is a constant element in G that acts as the identity for the group operation.
    constant identity: G

    -- Axioms define the properties that must hold true for any group:
    axioms {
        -- Associativity: The grouping of operations does not change the result.
        ∀ a, b, c ∈ G:
            multiply(a, multiply(b, c)) = multiply(multiply(a, b), c)

        -- Identity element: Any element multiplied by the identity remains unchanged.
        ∀ a ∈ G:
            multiply(a, identity) = a

        -- Inverse element: An element multiplied by its inverse results in the identity element.
        ∀ a ∈ G:
            multiply(a, inverse(a)) = identity
    }
}

-- Concrete implementation of the Group structure using the set of integers and addition.
structure IntegerAddition extends Group(Integer) {
    -- Define 'multiply' as integer addition.
    operation multiply = (a, b) => a + b
    -- Define 'inverse' as the negation of an integer.
    operation inverse = a => -a
    -- Define 'identity' as the integer 0.
    constant identity = 0
